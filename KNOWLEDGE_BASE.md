### 2025-09-05: Email System Investigation

#### ‚ùå What Doesn't Work Anymore
- **MailChannels Free Tier** - DISCONTINUED as of August 31, 2024
  - Previously worked with Cloudflare Workers for free
  - Now returns 401 Unauthorized even with proper Domain Lockdown
  - Attempted fixes that failed:
    - Adding SPF record with `include:relay.mailchannels.net`
    - Adding Domain Lockdown TXT record `_mailchannels`
    - Using various API endpoints
  - **Conclusion**: MailChannels ended their free Cloudflare Workers integration

- **Cloudflare Email Routing API** (`/email/routing/addresses/`) 
  - This is for RECEIVING emails, not sending
  - Common misconception that it can send emails

#### ‚úÖ What Actually Works: Resend (Current Solution)
**Resend API** - The working solution as of 2025-09-05
- **Setup Process**:
  1. Sign up at https://resend.com (free tier: 100 emails/day, 3000/month)
  2. Add domain via Cloudflare integration (automatic DNS setup)
  3. Get API key from Resend dashboard
  4. Add `RESEND_API_KEY` to Cloudflare Worker environment variables
  5. Update Worker code to use Resend API endpoint

- **Required DNS Records** (automatically added via Cloudflare integration):
  - MX record: `send` ‚Üí `feedback-smtp.eu-west-1.amazonses.com`
  - DKIM record: `resend._domainkey` ‚Üí (long DKIM key)
  - SPF record: `v=spf1 include:amazonses.com ~all`

- **Worker Configuration**:
  - Environment variable: `RESEND_API_KEY` (as Secret in Cloudflare)
  - API endpoint: `https://api.resend.com/emails`
  - Can send from: `noreply@rubenayla.xyz` after domain verification

#### üîÑ Migration Path
1. **Old Setup** (MailChannels - NO LONGER WORKS):
   - Worker ‚Üí MailChannels API (`api.mailchannels.net`)
   - Required Domain Lockdown TXT record
   - Free but discontinued

2. **New Setup** (Resend - WORKING):
   - Worker ‚Üí Resend API (`api.resend.com`)
   - Requires Resend account and API key
   - Free tier sufficient for small projects
   - Better documentation and support

#### üîë Key Discoveries
- **MailChannels shutdown** - Despite conflicting documentation, MailChannels free tier is definitively dead as of August 31, 2024
- **Resend is the recommended alternative** - Officially documented by Cloudflare, easy setup
- **Domain verification is critical** - Emails won't send without proper DNS records
- **Cloudflare integration simplifies DNS** - Use "Sign in to Cloudflare" button in Resend for automatic setup

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Decisions

### Email System  
- **Current**: Cloudflare Worker ‚Üí Resend API
- **Why**: MailChannels discontinued free tier on August 31, 2024
- **Previous approach**: MailChannels (stopped working)
- **Alternative considered**: Direct SMTP from Python backend

### Database
- **ONLY ONE DATABASE**: Hetzner Production (91.98.68.236:5432/partle)
- **Never create local databases** - User explicitly forbid this
- **Always verify DATABASE_URL** before any operation

### Ports
- Frontend: 3000 (React/Vite standard)
- Backend: 8000 (FastAPI standard)  
- Database: 5432 (PostgreSQL standard)

## üîê Security Incidents

### Git Credential Exposure (2025-09-05)
- **Issue**: Committed `backend/downloaded_server.env` with secrets
- **Resolution**: Rotated all credentials, cleaned Git history
- **Lesson**: Always check files before committing, never hardcode credentials

### Current Credentials Status
- All credentials rotated on 2025-09-05
- Using environment variables exclusively
- Secrets stored in Cloudflare Worker environment variables

---

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### "Network Error" on Frontend
- **Cause**: Backend not running or wrong port
- **Solution**: Ensure backend runs on port 8000, check VITE_API_BASE

### Email Not Sending
- **Cause**: Missing Domain Lockdown record
- **Solution**: Add `_mailchannels` TXT record with Worker subdomain

### GitHub Actions Failing
- **Cause**: Poetry not in PATH for deploy user
- **Solution**: Add `export PATH="/home/deploy/.local/bin:$PATH"`
