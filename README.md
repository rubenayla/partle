# Partle
Search and find products near you, in any store.

Wallapop has commercial accounts now, with lots of expensive products littering the app because the stores are willing to pay premium subscriptions, because they actually need the visibility. Google Maps is trying (unsuccessfully) to integrate the products into the app too. I think the need is there, you can see it in these tangential apps trying to do it but not quite implementing it well.

For example, I want to search a product, sort by price and location, and find stores that are open now.

Yes, Amazon and AliExpress are taking a huge part of the market, but they are not ideal for super fast small purchases people often do on the go, to finish a task now, not tomorrow. Also, lots of stores are fed up of Amazon rules and want to sell their own way, with freedom. This market will never die. On top of that, there's a big push to buy and manufacture locally that will benefit this app.

## üöÄ Features
- üîç Search by part name or spec (e.g. "JST 6-pin", "M8 locking nut")
- üìç View available stock in nearby stores
- üó∫ Toggle between list and map view
- ‚ö° Quick sign-in with passkeys (fallback to email + password)

## To-Do
- Hosting partle.rubenayla.xyz
- Backend
- Add Accounts
    > Required mainly just to upload products. Also rate them, save favourites, skip ads with paid tiers etc.
    - Default sign-in uses passkeys (WebAuthn/FIDO2)
    - Fallback to email + password
    - Single email field: existing emails sign in, new ones create an account
- add modification date to db and system
- Add API so clients can add products (and stores?)
- Add UI to add stores
- Add UI to add products
- Tune the reliability rating of the info uploaded. It should go -1 to 1. Start at 0, depending on other people ratings get modified.
- Get data
    - Scraping?
        - Google Maps
        - Amazon
        - Wallapop?
    - Ask gpt sources
- The product of each store must have a unique name. If you don't agree with the data, several versions will appear, with capability to up/down vote them. It just like several products squished together in the same frontend card.
- Mechanism to store searches performed by users so we can know what products are more demanded
- Consider removing Tailwind CSS. What's it for?

### Long term, not urgent
- Mobile version (bottom to top, bar at the bottom with easy interface. Go ahead to new standards)
- Make map take the whole screen while keeping list with 4xl
Explore direct public key login (passkeys) so the browser handles authentication. If the key is lost, allow email-based reset.
- Do evaluation of each metric by the users, when
- Consider composite search mode with slide bars to select what I care more about, and instead of filter do a score assignation. For example, prioritize stock and distance over price when it's urgent, or prioritize price 
- Do AI search, consider external services or a language model that maps high level abstraction of the query with the closest product matches in the vector space.

## üõ† Tech Stack

- Vite + React + Tailwind CSS
- Leaflet (OpenStreetMap) for map view
- FastAPI (planned) for backend API

## Introduction
Long term idea: When I want a strange M8 left-handed lock nut, some large metal zip tie or connector, having to go to 30 stores asking for the product is innefficient. Connect local business databases with the app so all products are listed there. Add AI thingy to load them to the database just by recording with the phone. It recognizes the products, screenshots them, lists the price, geo location and everything. You can go around stores and record to add thousands of products.
Add ratings.
Monetize with ads and premium positioning. Similar to wallapop (actually there are already businesses uploading stuff there). However, our idea is not to buy through the app, but just locate the products so they can be bought in person. It's for people who want to buy locally (super fast now), not online. For online shopping Aliexpress and Amazon are unbeatable.

Like Amazon, Aliexpress, Temu, Banggood, etc., but just lists products that are already available in local shops.

Let local businesses make an account, list the products, address, prices
Let people rate the business, products, and accuracy of the data (schedule)

## üõ† Dev Setup

### 1. Install Node.js (Ubuntu)

Recommended: use **nvm** for easier upgrades.

```bash
# Install nvm
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash

# Load nvm into shell
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
source "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"

# Install and use latest LTS version of Node.js
nvm install --lts
nvm use --lts
```

---

### 2. Create and run the frontend app

From the project root (`partle/`):

```bash
npm create vite@latest frontend -- --template react
cd frontend
npm install
```

---

### 3. Install Tailwind CSS (stable version)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Use **Tailwind CSS v3** for compatibility with tooling

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss@^3 postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

This creates:
- `tailwind.config.js`
- `postcss.config.js`

Then edit `tailwind.config.js`:

```js
content: [
  "./index.html",
  "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
],
```

And in `src/index.css`, add:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

---

### 4. Start the backend API

From the `backend/` folder start the FastAPI server:

```bash
cd backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

### 5. Start the frontend app

Run the Vite dev server from inside the `frontend/` folder:

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm run dev
```

Then visit `http://localhost:5173` in your browser. **Important:** use
`localhost` in the URL (not `127.0.0.1`) so it matches the CORS rule configured
in `backend/app/main.py`.
