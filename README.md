## Introduction
Long term idea: When I want a strange M8 left-handed lock nut, some large metal zip tie or connector, having to go to 30 stores asking for the product is innefficient. Connect local business databases with the app so all products are listed there. Add AI thingy to load them to the database just by recording with the phone. It recognizes the products, screenshots them, lists the price, geo location and everything. You can go around stores and record to add thousands of products.
Add ratings.
Monetize with ads and premium positioning. Similar to wallapop (actually there are already businesses uploading stuff there). However, our idea is not to buy through the app, but just locate the products so they can be bought in person. It's for people who want to buy locally (super fast now), not online. For online shopping Aliexpress and Amazon are unbeatable.

Like Amazon, Aliexpress, Temu, Banggood, etc., but just lists products that are already available in local shops.

Let local businesses make an account, list the products, address, prices
Let people rate the business, products, and accuracy of the data (schedule)
