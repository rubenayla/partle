# accessible mcp servers!
Instead of running local MCP servers, you could expose your Partle API publicly and integrate ChatGPT directly with your API endpoints. This approach would involve:

  1. Secure Public Deployment: Deploy your FastAPI backend to a cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Heroku) with proper HTTPS and domain setup
  2. Authentication System: Implement API key authentication or OAuth to secure access - ChatGPT can use API keys in requests
  3. OpenAPI Integration: Leverage your existing FastAPI OpenAPI/Swagger schema - ChatGPT can read this to understand available endpoints and parameters
  4. Direct API Calls: Configure ChatGPT's "Actions" or "Custom GPTs" to call your public endpoints directly (e.g., GET /v1/products/search, POST 
  /v1/analytics/overview)
  5. Rate Limiting & Monitoring: Add proper rate limiting, logging, and monitoring to handle AI-generated traffic patterns

  This eliminates the need for local MCP servers entirely and provides a more scalable, cloud-native integration. The trade-off is increased complexity in deployment,
   security, and infrastructure management, but it offers better performance and eliminates the local server dependency.

# problem with hook for scroll
● Summary of the React Hooks Issue

  After extensive investigation, here's what we've discovered:

  The Problem:

  - Custom hooks in separate files fail with "Cannot read properties of null (reading
  'useState')"
  - React's internal context (__SECRET_INTERNALS_DO_NOT_USE_OR_YOU_WILL_BE_FIRED) is
  null
  - Only affects hooks imported from separate files, not inline code

  Root Cause:

  The issue stems from Vite's module resolution combined with React's CommonJS format:
  1. React ships as CommonJS (module.exports)
  2. Vite transforms these to ESM for the browser
  3. Something breaks when hooks are in separate files during this transformation

  Working Solutions:

  1. Inline Implementation (Currently used) ✅
    - Keeps all hook logic directly in the component
    - Fast and reliable
  2. Component Wrapper Pattern (Alternative)
    - Use InfiniteScrollWrapper component instead of a hook
    - Avoids the hook context issue entirely

  Failed Attempts:

  - ❌ React.StrictMode removal (helped performance but not the core issue)
  - ❌ Vite alias configuration
  - ❌ Force optimization of React deps
  - ❌ Different import styles

  Recommendation:

  Stick with the inline implementation for now. It's:
  - Working reliably
  - Performant
  - Simple to understand

  The custom hook issue appears to be a deep Vite/React integration bug that would
  require significant investigation to fully resolve.

- can we get rid of plain .js files and use .ts instead?
- i see a few new markdown files in the docs folder. Should we use mkdocs?
- Improve the scrapers so they get the image url and place it on the products in my website. I don't need to store the image, just the url. They would look much better.
- So now that we have an mcp (model context protocol), chatgpt should be able to read info from this server by using the mcp server? How could he do it?

# mcp for scraping when 5+ scrapers running
● Honest Assessment: MCP Scraping Agent

✅ PROS:
- Real examples exist - Firecrawl, Bright Data, crawl4ai MCP servers already working
- Autonomous monitoring - Can detect stuck scrapers, restart them, analyze logs
- Site adaptation - Could automatically adjust selectors when sites change
- Source discovery - Research and test new scraping targets
- Integration ready - Your Scrapy setup could plug into MCP easily

❌ CONS:
- Overkill for current scale - You have 2 spiders, not 50
- Development overhead - Weeks to build vs. minutes to fix spider limits
- Cost complexity - Need hosting, monitoring infrastructure
- New failure points - Agent could break scrapers that work fine
- Security risks - 2025 research shows MCP has prompt injection vulnerabilities

Why am i getting "Existing account – log in instead" in our unified register/login page?
- in product page, a clear "Back" button that goes to the previous page
- How to modify product. If you are the user, when you click a product to see it, allow editing? Or do it in other way
- In add product, add capability to add tags like #tag1 
- Add buttons to get feedback from users, and form page to receive it. The buttons will link to that page.
- Add several products fast and check they're there.
- Scrape products
- Create docs with sections for API use (people should be able to connect easily), database structure, standards, etc.
- [products|stores] toggle should go under filters
- MAKE MOBILE VERSION

- Store CRUD (3 → 4) – lets you seed real data from the UI.
- Parts under stores (5 → 6) – completes the core data model.
- Tune the reliability rating of the info uploaded. It should go -1 to 1. Start at 0, depending on other people ratings get modified.
- Users should be able to add products from other stores. Last updated time should be stored as parameter for every product. And who did that last update is relevant too.
- Get data
    - Scraping?
        - Google Maps
        - Amazon
        - Wallapop?
    - Ask gpt sources
- Mobile version (bar at the bottom with easy interface. Go ahead to new standards)
- The product of each store must have a unique name. If you don't agree with the data, several versions will appear, with capability to up/down vote them. It just like several products squished together in the same frontend card.
- seo for chatgpt searches so I can get pro users that will actually buy, being of benefit to the stores. Can charge the stores instead of the user, since use through chatgpt will be free

- once db is working with remote computer, not locally, tell codex to scrape sites, add the scraping software with tests and actually do some scraping
- Users report products (illegal etc)
- Improve unit tests
- Map toggle (7) – visual polish that sells the idea.
- add "Forgot password?" via email, need vercel or something
    - vercel put .env as in the example?
- Hosting partle.rubenayla.xyz
- Add some color
- Ok, now i'd like to implement the feature to recover my password. The typical button "Forgot your password?" or "Recover your password with an email" something like that.

## Not urgent, long term
- When we got to the end of the page, Use Shopify Storefront API directly:
  - Public API, no authentication needed for product search
  - GraphQL for flexible queries
  - Pagination support for infinite scroll
  - Product data includes prices, images, descriptions
- AI search, call chatgpt with search engine to add better product results when doing searches that result in few or no products
- Mechanism to store searches performed by users so we can know what products are more demanded
- How to optimize for AI like chatgpt, so they can use my website to search or see the results from my website
    - Think super long term: My AI knows what i have and what i need, and automatically searches for the best products for me. Once one is good enough, it suggests it to me, taking even my calendar into account, when will i need it, time to arrive etc.
- limit max item count per row to 3?
- Think of better name. People don't understand what it is, how to write etc.
- Allow custom images and add the UI to add them, so we don't depend on other websites.
- Ask gemini to try to implement FIDO2. I think the best way is using SimpleWebAuthn. I already have Node.js for the frontend, so no extra dependencies. Should probably use the same PostgreSQL database i have, let Node return user_id and email, FastAPI issues the token.
- AI thingy to load them to the database just by recording with the phone. It recognizes the products, screenshots them, lists the price, geo location and everything. You can go around stores and record to add thousands of products.
- What if i put the search terms at the left, the search bar at the top of the left section, and on startup the website already includes products as suggestions? The left search terms stay there, and the scroll only includes the products. The right is blank or left for ads etc.
- Make map take the whole screen while keeping list with 4xl
Explore direct public key login (passkeys) so the browser handles authentication. If the key is lost, allow email-based reset.
- Do evaluation of each metric by the users, when
- Consider composite search mode with slide bars to select what I care more about, and instead of filter do a score assignation. For example, prioritize stock and distance over price when it's urgent, or prioritize price 
- Do AI search, consider external services or a language model that maps high level abstraction of the query with the closest product matches in the vector space.
- Implement multiple login methods:
    - Passkey (WebAuthn) for passwordless authentication.
    - Google-linked authentication (OAuth 2.0).
    - Ensure all methods link to a single user identity.
    - Provide options for managing these methods in account settings.
- Add 'relevant' sorting method
- Search with regex?
- Search with free form descriptions and use AI, creating abstractions of the product and the search, and mapping the closest?
    - Or just let chatgpt search using our api
- MCP should let my personal AI look around for products that will be actually interesting to me, and that AI, my personal one that might even run locally or with privacy taken into account, with my data safe, it will decide what i probably want, and suggest it to me, instead of letting external AIs spam me with ads. I believe the ad industry is going to change. We can achieve superhuman efficiency letting the AI even do purchases below a certain price threshold. If we happen to be close to a store that has what we want, just notify us and let us know we don't even have to search for it or travel. I there's something i don't want and has value, it might suggest me to sell it, with a client alreay ready to buy. Since the client is an AI, this is not wasting anyone's time. They could be like 'potential' transactions performed by the AI, and when both human parties agree, it's performed with ease.
