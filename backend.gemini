## Backend Development

### How to set up the database

Before running migrations, ensure the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable is set. For example:

```bash
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost/partle_db"
# Or for SQLite (be aware of ALTER TABLE limitations):
# export DATABASE_URL="sqlite:///./sql_app.db"
#
# Note: SQLite has limited ALTER TABLE capabilities and does not support
# operations like dropping NOT NULL constraints directly. If you encounter
# "sqlite3.OperationalError: near \"ALTER\": syntax error\" during migrations,
# it's recommended to use PostgreSQL or manually adjust the migration script
# for SQLite's limitations.
```

Then, from inside the `backend/` directory, run:

```bash
poetry run alembic upgrade head
```

### How to start the backend locally

From inside the `backend/` directory, run:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

This will start the backend server, typically accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Backend Deployment

Note that Vercel is primarily used for frontend deployment. The backend typically requires a separate deployment strategy (e.g., to a dedicated server or a cloud function service).
