## Frontend Development

### How to start the frontend locally

To start the frontend development server, navigate to the `frontend/` directory and run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will typically start the application on `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use).

### Vercel Deployment

To deploy the frontend to Vercel, navigate to the `frontend/` directory and run:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This script will execute the `vercel` command. Follow the prompts to link your project and deploy.

### Troubleshooting: npm WARN Unknown env config "http-proxy"

This warning often indicates an unrecognized configuration setting in your global npm configuration or environment variables. It's usually harmless but can be resolved by checking and removing any `http-proxy` or `https-proxy` settings in:

*   Your global `.npmrc` file (e.g., `~/.npmrc` on Linux/macOS).
*   Your npm configuration (`npm config list` or `npm config get http-proxy`).
*   Your system's environment variables (`echo $HTTP_PROXY` or `echo $HTTPS_PROXY`).

You can remove npm config settings using `npm config delete http-proxy`.

### Troubleshooting: Port Conflicts

If the development server starts on a port other than 5173 (e.g., 5175), it means port 5173 is already in use. You can find and terminate the process using that port (on Linux/macOS) with:

1.  **Find the process ID (PID):**
    ```bash
    sudo lsof -i :5173
    ```
2.  **Kill the process:**
    ```bash
    kill -9 <PID>
    ```
    (Replace `<PID>` with the actual process ID found in the previous step.)
